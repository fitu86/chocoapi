# Supporting Directus

> Directus is both _premium_ and _free_ — two things that don't often go together. It takes significant resources to maintain and advance the platform. If you'd like to help keep Directus active and open-source please consider supporting it through one of the methods below.

## Financial Support
Talented full-time and part-time staff, infrastructure, and third-party services are just some of our organization's expenses, and revenue from our Cloud services and donations from sponsors dosen't fully cover those costs. Below are a few ways to help us keep the lights on and move towards self-sufficiency.

* **GitHub Sponsors** — Monthly donations via [GitHub Sponsors](#) are the most reliable form of financial support, and donations made directly to our core developers are currently **doubled** by GitHub's matching program!
    * [rijkvanzanten](https://github.com/rijkvanzanten) — Technical Lead
    * [WoLfulus](https://github.com/WoLfulus) —
    * [Nitwel](https://github.com/Nitwel) —
* **Merch** — Our merchandise is a great way to support Directus – you get a shirt and we get some financial support and advertising. Simply make an appropriate financial donation through GitHub Sponsors, message us with sizing/shipping details, and we'll get it shipped!
* **Commissioned Features** — If you need to an interface, layout, or other custom feature – just reach out to our parent company to design and build it for you. If it can be merged into our Core codebase then it even benefits the entire community!
* **Expedited Fixes** — We triage all reported bugs based on priority and how long the fix is estimated to take. If you need a specific issue resolved sooner, reach out to us for a quote.
* **Premium Support** — See [Premium Support](#)

## Other Contributions
Even without financial or even technical knowledge, it's still super easy to help out. Below are several ways anyone can help improve our ecosystem.

* **Code Pull Requests** — Squashing bugs, optimizing the codebase, increasing test coverage, and adding new features, are all extremely valuable. Learn more in our [Contributors Guide](#).
* **Docs** — Not technical? We have plenty of documentation that can always use some extra attention. Fixing spelling errors, writing new articles, or checking for broken links... it all helps.
* **Translations** — Every translation enables users in new locales to use our international platform. Our Crowdin integration makes polishing existing translations or creating new ones a breeze.
* **Bug Reporting** — If you encounter an issue within Directus, no matter how small, we would love to hear about it. Proper bug reporing helps our team assess the platform's stability.
* **Brand Advocacy** — You can create _perfect_ software, but if no one knows about it, it's all for naught. Marketing and advertising are expensive, but you can help us avoid these costs through the following:
    * **GitHub Stars** — The primary metric by which we measure our success. It only takes five seconds to head to [directus/directus](#) and click the star — enough in a short period of time and Directus gets featured on GitHub's trending page.
    * **Social Posts** — A quick post mentioning [@directus](https://twitter.com/directus) goes a long way, and we re-tweet some of our favorite shout-outs to our 30K+ followers.
    * **Testimonials** — _One sentence._ Even that was a sentence, and it was only two words! If you're a fan of Directus, we'd love to hear why with a short endorsement. Shoot us an email, Tweet, or Discord message your name, title, and company
