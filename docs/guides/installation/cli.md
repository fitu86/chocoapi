# Installing from CLI

## 1. Confirm Minimum Requirements are Met

**The only requirements for Directus is an actively maintained version of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).** Currently that is v10+, however in April 2021,
node v10 will leave _Maintenance Long-Term Support (LTS)_ status, and node v12+ will become the new
minimum requirement.

### Databases

Directus currently supports the following databases, with our minimum version being based on each
vendor's official support/LTS.

| Database      | Version |
| ------------- | ------- |
| PostgreSQL    | 9.5+    |
| MySQL         | 5.6+    |
| SQLite        | 3+      |
| MS-SQL Server | 13.0+   |
| OracleDB      | TBD     |
| MariaDB       | 10.1+   |

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
::: tip
Variants In addition to the databases above, other variants are also supported, including **AWS Aurora** (MySQL), and **AWS Redshift** (PostgreSQL).

```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

project.
